# Settin up Partkeepr

## What is Partkeepr?

<!-- excerpt -->

It's a PHP web app for managing an inventory of electronic parts.

<!-- end excerpt -->

## Setup

1) A container (I set one up on my primary Proxmox node)

- hostname: **keeper**
    - Ubuntu 20.04
        - [Debian/Ubuntu have an awesome Apache setup out of the box](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/05/apache-101-0-wordpress-in-15-minutes/)
    - 6Gb root disk (database will be external)
    - 4Gb RAM, 2 CPUs, 1Gb swap

2) Dependencies and Install

- **this guide is intended for use on a clean Ubuntu 20.04 install** you have been warned
- first, update the system
    - `apt update` and `apt upgrade`
- `php7.4` is not supported yet -- but `php7.1` is!
    - Add the ppa for supported PHP versions: `add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php`
        - if you can't find the command, install `software-properties-common`
    - While you're at it, follow the instructions and `add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/apache2`
- now you can: `apt install apache2 php7.1 php7.1-{curl,ldap,bcmath,gd,dom}`
- follow these instructions to install `composer` -> [](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- time to install `partkeepr`
    - `git clone https://github.com/partkeepr/PartKeepr`
    - follow the [instructions from the repo](https://github.com/partkeepr/PartKeepr/blob/master/documentation/Installation.md)
        - a note about running as root: for simplicity bypass the warnings about running `composer` as the superuser. We are running in a container with this single responsiblity so many risks are already mitigated. **However**, for a proper "production" system, an admin/system user with **only the privileges required to run PartKeeper** is a necessity. 

3) Configure Apache

I adapted this from the example configuration in the docs.
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName partkeepr.lb-zone.xyz
	DocumentRoot /var/www/PartKeepr/web/
	AcceptPathInfo on

	ErrorDocument 403 "<h1>PartKeepr is down. Check back in a few minutes or email Val.</h1>"

	<Directory /var/www/PartKeepr/web/>
		Require all granted
		AllowOverride All
	</Directory>

	## Logging
	ErrorLog "/var/log/apache2/partkeepr.lb-zone.xyz_error.log"
	ServerSignature Off
	CustomLog "/var/log/apache2/partkeepr.lb-zone.xyz_access.log" combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Install that to `/etc/apache2/sites-available/partkeepr.lb-zone.xyz.conf` and run `a2ensite partkeepr.lb-zone.xyz`

I'll also need a DNS record for partkeepr.lb-zone.xyz. With this basic configuration, this will point to the internal IP of `keeper`. If I wanted to open this up I would point that to the public IP of my reverse proxy server handling `keeper`.

For now, I just chucked an entry in `/etc/hosts` on my workstation while I'm gettin things configured.
